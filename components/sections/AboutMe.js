          I am a full-stack software engineer with 2 years of industry experience working in web applications.
          Currently, I specialize in CSS, HTML, Javascript with AngularJS (1.x), React and Vue.js frameworks for the front-end and PHP with Laravel framework and SQL database for the back-end.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>

          One of my proudest accomplishments as a software engineer was building a website from scratch for Cafe Maddy Cab, an initiative that pays for cab rides for the vulnerable Asian minority population in New York City.
          Between May and November 2022, our small team of volunteers raised a total of $106,880 and provided 4,134 safe rides for the AAPI community.
          I strive to bring that kind of passion and success to all of my opportunities.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          In my spare time, I enjoy rock climbing, pottery, making cakes, and watching the NFL.
